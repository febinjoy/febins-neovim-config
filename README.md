# Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my customized Neovim configuration, inspired by the "Neovim for Newbs" series by [Typecraft Dev](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev). While it draws from the series, I have made several modifications and enhancements to suit my needs.

## Features

- **LSP Servers**: Support for Lua, Python, C#, Golang, TypeScript, JavaScript, Bash, CSS, HTML, XML, and GraphQL.
- **Plugin Manager**: Utilizing Lazy and Mason for efficient plugin management and LSP installation.
- **UI Enhancements**:
    - `bufferline` for enhanced buffer visibility.
    - `lualine` for a customised status line.
    - `neo-tree` for advanced file tree navigation.
- **Commenting**: `nvim-comment` for easy commenting.
- **Fuzzy Finder**: `telescope` for powerful file searching and picking.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: `treesitter` for superior syntax highlighting and code comprehension.
- **Code suggestion and auto completion**
- And much more...

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:febinjoy/febins-neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```
## Usage

Explore the various features and plugins to enhance your coding experience. Feel free to further customize the configuration to meet your workflow requirements using Lazy and Mason.
