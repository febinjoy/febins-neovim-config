# Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my customized Neovim configuration, inspired by the "Neovim for Newbs" series by [Typecraft Dev](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev). While it draws from the series, I have made several modifications and enhancements to suit my needs.

## Features

- **LSP Servers**: Support for Lua, Python, C#, Golang, TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, Bash, Docker Compose, JSON, CSS, HTML, XML, and GraphQL.
- **Plugin Manager**: Utilizing Lazy and Mason for efficient plugin management and LSP installation.
- **UI Enhancements**:
  - `bufferline` for enhanced buffer visibility.
  - `lualine` for a customizable status line.
  - `neo-tree` for advanced file tree navigation.
- **Commenting**: `nvim-comment` for easy commenting.
- **Fuzzy Finder**: `telescope` for powerful file searching and picking.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: `treesitter` for superior syntax highlighting and code comprehension.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:febinjoy/neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
   ```
Open Neovim and enjoy your customized setup!

Explore the various features and plugins to enhance your coding experience. Feel free to further customize the configuration to meet your workflow requirements using Lazy and Mason. .
